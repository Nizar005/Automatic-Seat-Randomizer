# Automatic-Seat-Randomizer

The purpose of this program is to randomize the seat pairs from my class. every pair is consist of 2 people, 1 girl and 1 boy.
because the total student in the class is 33 (15 boy 18 girl) the rule is slightly adjusted with 2 girls will seat together and 1 girl is seat alone. :(

the source code is free to use and edit (if you can because i dont follow pep8 so the program is very messy, and i very lazy to clean that up good luck 🙏🙏)
