# Automatic-Seat-Randomizer

The purpose of this program is to randomize the seat pairs from my class. every pair is consist of 2 people, 1 girl and 1 boy.
because the total student in the class is 33 (15 boy 18 girl) the rule is slightly adjusted with 2 girls will seat together and 1 girl is seat alone. :(
